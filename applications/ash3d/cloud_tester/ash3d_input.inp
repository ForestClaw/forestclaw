#GENERAL SOURCE PARAMETERS. DO NOT DELETE ANY LINES 
#  The first line of this block identifies the projection used and the form of 
#  the input coordinates and is of the following format: 
#    latlonflag projflag (variable list of projection parameters) 
#  projflag should describe the projection used for both the windfile(s) and 
#  the input coordinates.  Currently, these need to be the same projection. 
#  For a particular projflag, additional values are read defining the projection. 
#    latlonflag = 0 if the input coordinates are already projected

#WIND OPTIONS 
#Ash3d will read from either a single 1-D wind sounding, or gridded, time- 
#dependent 3-D wind data, depending on the value of the parameter iwind. 
#For iwind = 1, read from a 1-D wind sounding 
#            2, read from 3D gridded ASCII files generated by the Java script 
#               ReadNAM216forAsh3d or analogous. 
#            3, read directly from a single NetCDF file. 
#            4, read directly from multiple NetCDF files. 
#The parameter iwindFormat specifies the format of the wind files, as follows: 
# iwindFormat =  1: ASCII files (this is redundant with iwind=2 
#                2: NAM_216pw 45km files (provided by Peter Webley)

#Many plumes extend  higher than the maximum height of mesoscale models. 
#Ash3d handles this as determined by the parameter iHeightHandler, as follows: 
#for iHeightHandler = 1, stop the program if the plume height exceeds mesoscale height 
#                     2, wind velocity at levels above the highest node  
#                        equal that of the highest node.  Temperatures in the 
#                        upper nodes dont change between 11 and 20 km; above 
#                        20 km they increase by 2 C/km, as in the Standard 
#                        atmosphere.  A warning is written to the log file. 
#Checking divergence:  Some wind modeled wind fields are not very good at  
#                      conserving mass, meaning that the divergence of velocity 
#                      in each cell is not close to zero.  The model can check 
#                      the divergence of the wind field if desired.
