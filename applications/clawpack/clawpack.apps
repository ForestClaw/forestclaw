## ------------------------- Clawpack examples ----------------------
##
## Hyperbolic problems using Clawpack 4.6 and 5.0 
## 
## Many of these examples have been taken from the original 
## Clawpack software package, developed by R. J. LeVeque, 
## and many others. (www.clawpack.org)

## For descriptions of the wave propagation algorithm used 
## in Clawpack, see :

## Simple examples to test options handling, etc, but no solvers.

## ---------------------------
## No solver
## ---------------------------
## This needs work because all exchange functions (copy, average, interpolate) are 
## stored in solvers, and not in a patch.  To fix this, the patch needs to 
## know something about data layout.  The clawpatch currently doesn't know about 
## data layout.
