## ------------------------- Clawpack examples ----------------------
##
## Hyperbolic problems using Clawpack 4.6 and 5.0 
## 
## Many of these examples have been taken from the original 
## Clawpack software package, developed by R. J. LeVeque, 
## and many others. (www.clawpack.org)
## 
## For descriptions of the wave propagation algorithm used 
## in Clawpack, see :

## ------------------------- Simple example -------------------------------- 
## Example : Don't using the 'app' for configuring options;  
##           This is how you might call ForestClaw from another
##           program.
