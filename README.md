# ForestClaw

ForestClaw (http://www.forestclaw.org/ForestClaw) is a parallel, multi-block adaptive finite volume
code  for solving PDEs on a hierarchy of logically Cartesian meshes.

Features of ForestClaw :

* A multi-resolution hierarchy of grids is stored  as a composite structure of non-
overlapping fixed sized  grids which are stored as leaves in a forest of quad- or octrees.

* Based on the highly scalable meshing library p4est (http://www.p4est.org)

* Solvers for hyperbolic PDEs are available, including Clawpack 4.x, Clawpack 5.0 and
GeoClaw (see http://www.clawpack.org).

* Users can easily extend ForestClaw with their own solvers.

* Fully parallel, using MPI distributed memory parallelism

* Visualization tools include Matlab scripts, VisClaw (from Clawpack) and VTK output.
