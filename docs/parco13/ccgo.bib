  abstract = {Even though the art of reservoir simulation has evolved through more
	than four decades, there is still a substantial research activity
	that aims toward faster, more robust, and more accurate reservoir
	simulators. Here we attempt to give the reader an introduction to
	the mathematics and the numerics behind reservoir simulation. We
	assume that the reader has a basic mathematical background at the
	undergraduate level and is acquainted with numerical methods, but
	no prior knowledge of the mathematics or physics that govern the
	reservoir flow process is needed. To give the reader an intuitive
	understanding of the equations that model filtration through porous
	media, we start with incompressible single-phase flow and move step-by-step
	to the black-oil model and compressible two-phase flow. For each
	case, we present a basic numerical scheme in detail, before we discuss
	a few alternative schemes that reflect trends in state-of-the-art
	reservoir simulation. Two and three-dimensional test cases are presented
	and discussed. Finally, for the most basic methods we include simple
	Matlab codes so that the reader can easily implement and become familiar
	with the basics of reservoir simulation.},

  abstract = {Level set techniques are numerical techniques for tracking the evolution
	of interfaces. They rely on two central embeddings; first, the embedding
	of the interface as the zero level set of a higher dimensional function,
	and second, the embedding (or extension) of the interface's velocity
	to this higher dimensional level set function. This paper applies
	Sethian's Fast Marching Method, which is a very fast technique for
	solving the eikonal and related equations, to the problem of building
	fast and appropriate extension velocities for the neighboring level
	sets. Our choice and construction of extension velocities serves
	several purposes. First, it provides a way of building velocities
	for neighboring level sets in the cases where the velocity is defined
	only on the front itself. Second, it provides a subgrid resolution
	not present in the standard level set approach. Third, it provides
	a way to update an interface according to a given velocity field
	prescribed on the front in such a way that the signed distance function
	is maintained, and the front is never re-initialized; this is valuable
	in many complex simulations. In this paper, we describe the details
	of such implementations, together with speed and convergence tests
	and applications to problems in visibility relevant to semi-conductor
	manufacturing and thin film physics.},

  abstract = {Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods (DGFEM) offer certain
	advantages over standard continuous finite element methods when applied
	to the spatial discretisation of the acoustic wave equation. For
	instance, the mass matrix has a block diagonal structure which, used
	in conjunction with an explicit time stepping scheme, gives an extremely
	economical scheme for time domain simulation. This feature is ubiquitous
	and extends to other time-dependent wave problems such as Maxwell's
	equations. An important consideration in computational wave propagation
	is the dispersive and dissipative properties of the discretisation
	scheme in comparison with those of the original system. We investigate
	these properties for two popular DGFEM schemes: the interior penalty
	discontinuous Galerkin finite element method applied to the second-order
	wave equation and a more general family of schemes applied to the
	corresponding first order system. We show how the analysis of the
	multi-dimensional case may be reduced to consideration of one-dimensional
	problems. We derive the dispersion error for various schemes and
	conjecture on the generalisation to higher order approximation in
	space},

	the way random variables are approximated. A class of models problems
	
	with random coefficients and source terms is cast in a variational
	setting.
	
	Specific quantities of interest are specified which are also random
	variables.
	
	A stochastic adjoint problem associated with the quantities of interest
	is
	
	formulated and a posteriori error estimates are derived. These are
	used to
	
	guide an adaptive algorithm which adjusts the sparse probabilistic
	grid so
	
	as to control the approximation error. Numerical examples are given
	to
	
	demonstrate the methodology for a specific model problem.},

  abstract = {Model reduction is often required in several applications, typically
	due to limited available time, computer memory or other restrictions.
	In problems that are related to partial differential equations, this
	often means that we are bound to use sparse meshes in the model for
	the forward problem. Conversely, if we are given more and more accurate
	measurements, we have to employ increasingly accurate forward problem
	solvers in order to exploit the information in the measurements.
	Optical diffusion tomography (ODT) is an example in which the typical
	required accuracy for the forward problem solver leads to computational
	times that may be unacceptable both in biomedical and industrial
	end applications. In this paper we review the approximation error
	theory and investigate the interplay between the mesh density and
	measurement accuracy in the case of optical diffusion tomography.
	We show that if the approximation errors are estimated and employed,
	it is possible to use mesh densities that would be unacceptable with
	a conventional measurement model.},

  abstract = {Today's computers allow us to simulate large, complex physical problems.
	Many times the mathematical models describing such problems are based
	on a relatively small amount of available information such as experimental
	measurements. The question arises whether the computed data could
	be used as the basis for decision in critical engineering, economic,
	and medicine applications. The representative list of engineering
	accidents occurred in the past years and their reasons illustrate
	the question. The paper describes a general framework for verification
	and validation (V\&V) which deals with this question. The framework
	is then applied to an illustrative engineering problem, in which
	the basis for decision is a specific quantity of interest, namely
	the probability that the quantity does not exceed a given value.
	The V\&V framework is applied and explained in detail. The result
	of the analysis is the computation of the failure probability as
	well as a quantification of the confidence in the computation, depending
	on the amount of available experimental data.},

	chosen for deal.II, a general purpose finite element library written
	in C++, is given. The library uses advanced object-oriented and data
	encapsulation techniques to break finite element implementations
	into smaller blocks that can be arranged to fit users requirements.
	Through this approach, deal.II supports a large number of different
	applications covering a wide range of scientific areas, programming
	methodologies, and application-specific algorithms, without imposing
	a rigid framework into which they have to fit. A judicious use of
	programming techniques allows us to avoid the computational costs
	frequently associated with abstract object-oriented class libraries.
	
	The paper presents a detailed description of the abstractions chosen
	for defining geometric information of meshes and the handling of
	degrees of freedom associated with finite element spaces, as well
	as of linear algebra, input/output capabilities and of interfaces
	to other software, such as visualization tools. Finally, some results
	obtained with applications built atop deal.II are shown to demonstrate
	the powerful capabilities of this toolbox.},

  journal = {ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software},

  abstract = {Finite element methods approximate solutions of partial differential
	equations by restricting the problem to a finite dimensional function
	space. In $hp$ adaptive finite element methods, one defines these
	discrete spaces by choosing different polynomial degrees for the
	shape functions defined on a locally refined mesh.
	
	Although this basic idea is quite simple, its implementation in algorithms
	and data structures is challenging. It has apparently not been documented
	in the literature in its most general form. Rather, most existing
	implementations appear to be for special combinations of finite elements,
	or for discontinuous Galerkin methods.
	
	In this article, we discuss generic data structures and algorithms
	used in the implementation of $hp$ methods for arbitrary elements,
	and the complications and pitfalls one encounters. As a consequence,
	we list the information a description of a finite element has to
	provide to the generic algorithms for it to be used in an $hp$ context.
	We support our claim that our reference implementation is efficient
	using numerical examples in two dimensions and three dimensions,
	and demonstrate that the $hp$-specific parts of the program do not
	dominate the total computing time. This reference implementation
	is also made available as part of the Open Source deal.II finite
	element library.},

  abstract = {The connection between Bayesian statistics and the technique of regularization
	for inverse problems has been given significant attention in recent
	years. For example, Bayes' law is frequently used as motivation for
	variational regularization methods of Tikhonov type. In this setting,
	the regularization function corresponds to the negative-log of the
	prior probability density; the fit-to-data function corresponds to
	the negative-log of the likelihood; and the regularized solution
	corresponds to the maximizer of the posterior density function, known
	as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of the unknown, which
	in our case is an image. Much of the work in this direction has focused
	on the development of techniques for efficient computation of MAP
	estimators (or regularized solutions). Less explored in the inverse
	problems community, and of interest to us in this paper, is the problem
	of sampling from the posterior density. To do this, we use a Markov
	chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which has previously appeared in
	the Bayesian statistics literature, is straightforward to implement,
	and provides a means of both estimation and uncertainty quantification
	for the unknown. Additionally, we show how to use the preconditioned
	conjugate gradient method to compute image samples in cases where
	direct methods are not feasible. And finally, the MCMC method provides
	samples of the noise and prior precision (inverse-variance) parameters,
	which makes regularization parameter selection unnecessary. We focus
	on linear models with independent and identically distributed Gaussian
	noise and define the prior using a Gaussian Markov random field.
	For our numerical experiments, we consider test cases from both image
	deconvolution and computed tomography, and our results show that
	the approach is effective and surprisingly computationally efficient,
	even in large-scale cases.},

	perturbed elliptic partial differential equations is presented. The
	multigrid method with {ILU} smoother and the Frequency Decomposition
	Method, based on a multiple coarse grid correction, were implemented
	on a {MIMD} computer with distributed shared memory using a ring
	configuration for the first and a hypercube configuration for the

	and numbers of processors. An objective comparison of both methods
	against the multigrid method with highly parallelizable red-black
	Gau\ssSeidel smoother is made for the anisotropic equation and
	shows the superiority of both methods over the standard approach.
	The speedup of the {ILU} smoother is modelled and the influence of
	computer architecture on the speedup is discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the reconstruction of two-dimensional objects
	from laboratory-controlled data in microwave tomography. This inverse
	problem is commonly ill-posed and nonlinear, therefore we propose
	to solve it in a Bayesian estimation framework using an iterative
	scheme to solve the optimization problem. This approach allows us
	to introduce a priori knowledge about the object function to be reconstructed.
	The experimental data were obtained in a controlled environment at
	Institut Fresnel (Marseille, France). The considered targets are
	either metallic or dielectric homogeneous cylinders. In this paper,
	the authors have only considered the data corresponding to the transverse
	magnetic polarization case. For these targets, the presented results
	show the potentiality of the proposed regularization scheme and the
	interest of these experimental data for testing inverse algorithms.},

	in sparse linear algebra. In contrast to the uniform regularity
	
	of dense linear algebra, sparse operations encounter a broad spectrum
	
	of matrices ranging from the regular to the highly irregular.
	
	Harnessing the tremendous potential of throughput-oriented processors
	
	for sparse operations requires that we expose substantial
	
	fine-grained parallelism and impose sufficient regularity on execution
	
	paths and memory access patterns. We explore SpMV methods
	
	that are well-suited to throughput-oriented architectures like
	
	the GPU and which exploit several common sparsity classes. The
	
	techniques we propose are efficient, successfully utilizing large
	percentages
	
	of peak bandwidth. Furthermore, they deliver excellent
	
	total throughput, averaging 16 GFLOP/s and 10 GFLOP/s in double
	
	precision for structured grid and unstructured mesh matrices,
	
	respectively, on a GeForce GTX 285. This is roughly 2.8 times the
	
	throughput previously achieved on Cell BE and more than 10 times
	
	that of a quad-core Intel Clovertown system.},

  abstract = {We present a multilevel algorithm for the solution of a source identification
	problem in which the forward problem is an elliptic partial differential
	equation on the 2D unit box. The Hessian corresponds to a Tikhonov-regularized
	first-kind Fredholm equation. Our method uses an approximate Hessian
	operator for which, first, the spectral decomposition is known, and
	second, there exists a fast algorithm that can perform the spectral
	transform. Based on this decomposition we propose a conjugate gradients
	solver which we precondition with a multilevel subspace projection
	scheme. The coarse-level preconditioner is an exact solve and the
	finer-levels preconditioner is one step of the scaled Richardson
	iteration. As a model problem, we consider the 2D-Neumann Poisson
	problem with variable coefficients and partial observations. The
	approximate Hessian for this case is the Hessian related to a problem
	with constant coefficients and full observations. We can use a fast
	cosine transform to compute the spectral transforms. We examine the
	effect of using Galerkin or level-discretized Hessian operators and
	we provide results from numerical experiments that indicate the effectiveness
	of the method for full and partial observations.},

  abstract = {We investigate whether the recent slow-down of Whillans Ice Stream
	(WIS), West Antarctica, may lead to its complete stoppage in the
	near future, using a numerical model. Basal resistance to ice-stream
	motion is represented by a continuous till layer whose strength changes
	in response to basal melting and freezing. We implement a basal drainage
	system, which acts to hinder ice-stream stoppage through supply of
	extra water to those parts of the bed that are experiencing freezing.
	The ice module is a standard flowline model with parameterized key
	out-of-plane effects (Raymond, 1996). The most important result of
	our modeling effort is that we never obtained a slow-down that would
	not be followed by a complete stoppage within <100 years. WIS slow-down
	can be avoided in the model if large basal water-input rates are
	assumed, to satisfy basal freezing. In comparison, the tested perturbations
	in WIS width and mass balance had a relatively small effect on the
	tendency of the simulated ice stream to slow down. These results
	underscore the need for more quantitative constraints on the efficiency
	of sub-ice-stream water drainage. We conjecture that the present-day
	slow-down of WIS will evolve to shut-down in the next few decades,
	unless an addition of basal water prevents freeze-on-driven bed strengthening.},

  abstract = {Iterative inversion methods have been unsuccessful at inverting seismic
	data obtained from complicated earth models (e.g. the Marmousi model),
	the primary difficulty being the presence of numerous local minima
	in the objective function. The presence of local minima at all scales
	in the seismic inversion problem prevent iterative methods of inversion
	from attaining a reasonable degree of convergence to the neighborhood
	of the global minimum. The multigrid method is a technique that improves
	the performance of iterative inversion by decomposing the problem
	by scale. At long scales there are fewer local minima and those that
	remain are further apart from each other. Thus, at long scales iterative
	methods can get closer to the neighborhood of the global minimum.
	We apply the multigrid method to a subsampled, lowfrequency version
	of the Marmousi data set. Although issues of source estimation, source
	bandwidth, and noise are not treated, results show that iterative
	inversion methods perform much better when employed with a decomposition

	differentiation where derivatives are approximated, automatic differentiation
	generates derivatives that are accurate up to machine precision.
	The so-called forward mode of automatic differentiation computes
	derivatives by carrying forward a gradient associated with each intermediate
	variable simultaneously with the evaluation of the function itself.
	It is shown how software tools implementing the technology of automatic
	differentiation can benefit from simple concepts of shared memory
	programming to parallelize the gradient operations. The feasibility
	of our approach is demonstrated by numerical experiments. They were

	is an efficient technique to accurately evaluate the derivatives

	differentiation generates another program for the evaluation of the
	original function and its derivatives in a fully mechanical way.
	While the efficiency of this black box approach is already high as
	compared to numerical differentiation based on divided differences,
	automatic differentiation can be applied even more efficiently by
	taking into account high-level knowledge about the given computer
	program. We show that, in the case where the function involves a
	Fourier transform, the degree of parallelism in the program generated
	by automatic differentiation can be increased leading to a rich set
	of automatic parallelization strategies that are not available when
	employing a black box automatic parallelization approach. Experiments

  abstract = {The solution of many problems in science and engineering is based
	on computational kernels for the numerical treatment of partial differential
	equations (PDEs) or N-body problems. Traditional solution methods
	however reduce these to linear algebra or brute force algorithms
	on structured data sets. Larger and larger simulations require smarter
	algorithms to be tractable. Hierarchical tree algorithms represent
	such a class, both for PDEs and for N-body problems. However, their
	efficient parallelization is not straightforward. Some difficulties
	can be removed, if one can provide a fast dynamic load-balancing
	scheme to cope with the tree variations of the unstructured data
	sets. In this paper we propose a very cheap yet very efficient load-balancing
	scheme for tree algorithms based on space-filling curves. Furthermore
	we present the Parnass2 cluster, on which such parallel codes perform
	extremely well. The cluster consists of SMP PCs and a Myrinet network
	at Gigabit/s speed configured with full bisection bandwidth. It turns
	out that it does not only has the obvious price/performance advantage,
	but also an absolute performance, which is comparable to the latest
	commercial Cray T3E.},

	finite element methods named after or by Courant, $Q_1$, Crouzeix-Raviart,
	Han, Rannacher-Turek, and others for the Poisson, Stokes and Navier-Lame

  title = {A General Purpose Sampling Algorithm for Continuous Distributions
	(the t-walk)},
  journal = {Bayesian Analysis},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {263-283},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Abstract. We develop a new general purpose MCMC sampler for arbitrary
	con-
	
	tinuous distributions that requires no tuning. We call this MCMC the
	t-walk. The
	
	t-walk maintains two independent points in the sample space, and all
	moves are
	
	based on proposals that are then accepted with a standard Metropolis-Hastings
	
	acceptance probability on the product space. Hence the t-walk is provably
	con-
	
	vergent under the usual mild requirements. We restrict proposal distributions,
	or
	
	`moves', to those that produce an algorithm that is invariant to scale,
	and ap-
	
	proximately invariant to affine transformations of the state space.
	Hence scaling
	
	of proposals, and effectively also coordinate transformations, that
	might be used
	
	to increase efficiency of the sampler, are not needed since the t-walk's
	operation
	
	is identical on any scaled version of the target distribution. Four
	moves are given
	
	that result in an effective sampling algorithm.
	
	
	We use the simple device of updating only a random subset of coordinates
	at
	
	each step to allow application of the t-walk to high-dimensional problems.
	In a se-
	
	ries of test problems across dimensions we find that the t-walk is
	only a small factor
	
	less efficient than optimally tuned algorithms, but significantly
	outperforms gen-
	
	eral random-walk M-H samplers that are not tuned for specific problems.
	Further,
	
	the t-walk remains effective for target distributions for which no
	optimal affine
	
	transformation exists such as those where correlation structure is
	very different in
	
	differing regions of state space.
	
	
	Several examples are presented showing good mixing and convergence
	charac-
	
	teristics, varying in dimensions from 1 to 200 and with radically
	different scale and
	
	correlation structure, using exactly the same sampler. The t-walk
	is available for
	
	R, Python, MatLab and C++ at http://www.cimat.mx/~jac/twalk/.},

  abstract = {Migration-based traveltime (MBTT) formulation provides algorithms
	for automatically determining background velocities from full-waveform
	surface seismic reflection data using local optimization methods.
	In particular, it addresses the difficulty of the nonconvexity of
	the least-squares data misfit function. The method consists of parameterizing
	the reflectivity in the time domain through a migration step and
	providing a multiscale representation for the smooth background velocity.
	We present an implementation of the MBTT approach for a 2-D finite-difference
	(FD) full-wave acoustic model. Numerical analysis on a 2-D synthetic
	example shows the ability of the method to find much more reliable
	estimates of both long and short wavelengths of the velocity than
	the classical least-squares approach, even when starting from very
	poor initial guesses. This enlargement of the domain of attraction
	for the global minima of the least-squares misfit has a price: each
	evaluation of the new objective function requires, besides the usual
	FD full-wave forward modeling, an additional full-wave prestack migration.
	Hence, the FD implementation of the MBTT approach presented in this
	paper is expected to provide a useful tool for the inversion of data
	sets of moderate size.},

  abstract = {We study the implementation of the nonlinear Galerkin method as a
	multiresolution method when a two-level Fourier-collocation discretization
	is used. The set of collocation points with an even number of points
	is considered as the fine grid and decomposed into two coarse grids
	containing half as many points. Using these two grids we decompose
	the unknown into the sum of a large scale component containing only
	low frequency modes and based on one of the coarse grids and a small
	scale component containing only high frequency modes and based on
	the other coarse grid. This produces interesting connections between
	the physical space and the Fourier space representations of the function.
	A nonlinear Galerkin scheme is then applied to the Burgers equation;
	finally, implementation issues are discussed showing the advantages
	of the method.},

  abstract = {The performance of finite element computation depends strongly on
	the quality of the geometric mesh and the efficiency of the numerical
	solution of the linear systems resulting from the discretization
	of partial differential equation (PDE) models. It is common knowledge
	that mesh geometry affects not only the approximation error of the
	finite element solution but also the spectral properties of the corresponding
	stiffness matrix. In this paper, for typical second-orderelliptic
	problems, some refined relationships between the spectral condition
	number of the stiffness matrix and the mesh geometry are established
	for general finite element spaces defined on simplicial meshes. The
	derivation of such relations for general high-order elements is based
	on a new trace formula for the element stiffness matrix. It is shown
	that a few universal geometric quantities have the same dominant
	effect on the stiffness matrix conditioning for different finite
	element spaces. These results provide guidance to the studies of
	both linear algebraic solvers and the unstructured geometric meshing.},

	for solving non-linear ill-posed problems and give conditions that
	guarantee the convergence rate O( square root delta ) for the regularised
	solutions, where delta is a norm bound for the noise in the data.
	They illustrate these conditions for several examples including parameter
	estimation problems. In an appendix, they study the connection between
	the ill-posedness of a non-linear problem and its linearisation and
	show that this connection is rather weak. A sufficient condition
	for ill-posedness is given in the case that the non-linear operator
	is compact.},

	nonlinear iterations with inner conjugate gradient linear iterations,
	globalized by an Armijo backtracking line search, solved on a sequence
	of finer grids and higher frequencies to remain in the vicinity of
	the global optimum, inexactly terminated to prevent oversolving,
	preconditioned by L-BFGS/Frankel, regularized by a total variation
	operator to capture sharp interfaces, finely discretized by finite
	elements in the Lam\'{e} parameter space to provide flexibility and
	avoid bias, implemented in matrix-free fashion with adjoint-based
	computation of reduced gradient and reduced Hessian-vector products,
	checkpointed to avoid full spacetime waveform storage, and partitioned
	spatially across processors to parallelize the solutions of the forward
	and adjoint wave equations and the evaluation of gradient-like information.
	Several numerical examples demonstrate the grid independence of linear
	and nonlinear iterations, the effectiveness of the preconditioner,
	the ability to solve inverse problems with up to 17 million inversion
	parameters on up to 2048 processors, the effectiveness of multiscale
	continuation in keeping iterates in the basin of attraction of the
	global minimum, and the ability to fit the observational data while
	reconstructing the model with reasonable resolution and capturing
	sharp interfaces.},

  abstract = {A new scheme for differentiating complex mesh-based numerical models
	(e.g. finite element models), the
	
	Independent Set Perturbation Adjoint method (ISP-Adjoint), is presented.
	Differentiation of the matrices
	
	and source terms making up the discrete forward model is realized
	by a graph coloring approach
	
	(forming independent sets of variables) combined with a perturbation
	method to obtain gradients in
	
	numerical discretizations. This information is then convolved with
	the mathematical adjoint, which
	
	uses the transpose matrix of the discrete forward model. The adjoint
	code is simple to implement
	
	even with complex governing equations, discretization methods and
	non-linear parameterizations. Importantly,
	
	the adjoint code is independent of the implementation of the forward
	code. This greatly reduces
	
	the effort required to implement the adjoint model and maintain it
	as the forward model continues
	
	to be developed; as compared with more traditional approaches such
	as applying automatic differentiation
	
	tools. The approach can be readily extended to reduced-order models.
	The method is applied
	
	to a one-dimensional Burgerss equation problem, with a highly non-linear
	high-resolution discretization
	
	method, and to a two-dimensional, non-linear, reduced-order model
	of an idealized ocean gyre.},

  title = {A framework for the automation of generalised stability theory},
  journal = {arXiv},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {The traditional approach to investigating the stability of a physical
	system is to linearise the equations about a steady base flow, and
	to examine the eigenvalues of the linearised operator. Over the past
	several decades, it has been recognised that this approach only determines
	the asymptotic stability of the system, and neglects the possibility
	of transient perturbation growth arising due to the nonnormality
	of the system. This observation motivated the development of a more
	powerful generalised stability theory (GST), which focusses instead
	on the singular value decomposition of the linearised propagator
	of the system. While GST has had sig- nificant successes in understanding
	the stability of phenomena in geophysical fluid dynamics, its more
	widespread applicability has been hampered by the fact that computing
	the SVD requires both the tangent linear operator and its adjoint:
	deriving the tangent linear and adjoint models is usually a considerable
	challenge, and manually embedding them inside an eigensolver is laborious.
	In this paper, we present a framework for the automation of generalised
	stability theory, which overcomes these difficulties. Given a compact
	high-level symbolic representa- tion of a finite element discretisation
	of the nonlinear equations, efficient C++ code is automatically generated
	to assemble the forward, tangent linear and adjoint models; these
	models are then used to calculate the optimally growing perturbations
	to the forward model, and their growth rates. By automating the stability
	computations, we hope to make these powerful tools a routine part
	of computational analysis. The efficiency and generality of the framework
	is demonstrated with applications drawn from geophysical fluid dynamics,
	phase separation, chemical reaction-diffusion, and quantum mechanics.},

  abstract = {Concepts of turbulent flow control have become of growing importance
	during the last few years, following increased interest in the detailed
	structural scenario of turbulence??in particular our improved understanding
	of coherent structures on the one hand (the prerequisite), and a
	need for improvement of technological processes on the other (the
	goal). These considerations have mainly been followed by engineers
	and physicists concerned with problems in aerodynamics. It is our
	aim to draw the attention of a wider group of engineers to turbulent
	flow control in order to speed up the transfer of knowledge from
	aerodynamics to applications in other fields of engineering. In this
	paper an attempt is made to compile a major body of the available
	knowledge on flow control in separated and wall bounded turbulent
	flows. After a brief introduction of the basics of control theory
	(Section 2) and of the major flow structures and their stability
	characteristics (Section 3) free and wall bounded turbulent shear
	flows are discussed (Sections 4 and 5). This discussion summarizes
	the main relationships between structure and flow behaviour and shows
	possibilities of influencing properties of these flows such as increasing
	mixing or avoiding separation. },

  journal = {International Journal For Numerical Methods in Engineering},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {81},
  pages = {1581-1608},
  abstract = {We present a model reduction approach to the solution of large-scale
	statistical inverse problems in a Bayesian inference setting. A key
	to the model reduction is an efficient representation of the non-linear
	terms in the reduced model. To achieve this, we present a formulation
	that employs masked projection of the discrete equations; that is,
	we compute an approximation of the non-linear term using a select
	subset of interpolation points. Further, through this formulation
	we show similarities among the existing techniques of gappy proper
	orthogonal decomposition, missing point estimation, and empirical
	interpolation via coefficient-function approximation. The resulting
	model reduction methodology is applied to a highly non-linear combustion
	problem governed by an advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential
	equation (PDE). Our reduced model is used as a surrogate for a finite
	element discretization of the non-linear PDE within the Markov chain
	Monte Carlo sampling employed by the Bayesian inference approach.
	In two spatial dimensions, we show that this approach yields accurate
	results while reducing the computational cost by several orders of
	magnitude. For the full three-dimensional problem, a forward solve
	using a reduced model that has high fidelity over the input parameter
	space is more than two million times faster than the full-order finite
	element model, making tractable the solution of the statistical inverse
	problem that would otherwise require many years of CPU time. Copyright

  abstract = {The paper reviews the construction of hierarchical $H^1$-conforming
	shape functions for 1D (edge), 2D (triangle, quad) and 3D (hexahedron,
	tetrahedron, prism, pyramid) elements. The logic of implementation
	is based on identifying a set of core (kernel, bubble) 1D and 2D
	functions, and the use of specific edge-to-element and face-to-element
	extensions. The resulting implementation allows for an instantaneous
	modification (or redefinition) of core functions without any changes
	in the rest of the FE code. The 3D shape functions conform automatically
	to 1D edge and 2D face shape functions defined in local edge and
	face coordinates. In other words, the dependence of 3D shape functions
	on different edge and face orientations is taken into account at
	the level of element shape functions routine. This eliminates the
	use of sign factors during the assembly and simplifies dramatically
	the implementation of constrained approximation allowing for the
	presence of hanging nodes. The construction of shape functions is
	directly related to transfinite interpolation techniques used in
	mesh based geometry (MBG) descriptions.},

	is discretized by explicit multi-level or Runge-Kutta methods of
	order $\le 3$ (forward Euler time-differencing is included), and
	we study spatial discretizations by spectral and pseudospectral approximations
	associated with the general family of Jacobi polynomials. We prove
	that these fully explicit spectral approximations are stable provided
	their time step, $\Delta t$ , is restricted by the {CFL}-like condition
	$\Delta t < \operatorname{Const} \bullet {N^{ - 2}}$ , where $N$
	equals the spatial number of degrees of freedom. We give two independent
	proofs of this result, depending on two different choices of appropriate
	$L^2$-weighted norms. In both approaches, the proofs hinge on a certain
	inverse inequality interesting for its own sake. Our result confirms
	the commonly held belief that the above {CFL} stability restriction,
	which is extensively used in practical implementations, guarantees
	the stability (and hence the convergence) of fully-explicit spectral
	approximations in the nonperiodic case.},

	an adaptive and parallel multilevel approach for the solution of
	elliptic PDEs and especially of linear elasticity problems. We report
	on numerical experiments for the adaptive parallel multilevel solution
	of some test problems, namely the Poisson equation and Lam{\'e}'s
	equation. Here, we emphasize the parallel efficiency of the adaptive
	code even for simple test problems with little work to distribute,

	requires substantial less amount of memory than implementations based
	on tree type data structures and is easier to program in the sequential
	case. The parallelization takes place by a space-filling curve domain
	decomposition intimately connected to the hash table. The new data
	structure simplifies the parallelization of the code substantially
	and introduces a cheap way to solve the load balancing and mapping
	problem. We report on the main features of the method and give the

  abstract = {An optimal estimation method for simultaneously determining both basal
	slipperiness and basal topography from variations in surface flow
	velocity and topography along a flow line on ice streams and ice
	sheets is presented. We use Bayesian inference to update prior statistical
	estimates for basal topography and slipperiness using surface measurements
	along a flow line. Our main focus here is on how errors and spacing
	of surface data affect estimates of basal quantities and on possibly
	aliasing/mixing between basal slipperiness and basal topography.
	We find that the effects of spatial variations in basal topography
	and basal slipperiness on surface data can be accurately separated
	from each other, and mixing in retrieval does not pose a serious
	problem. For realistic surface data errors and density, small-amplitude
	perturbations in basal slipperiness can only be resolved for wavelengths
	larger than about 50 times the mean ice thickness. Bedrock topography
	is well resolved down to horizontal scale equal to about one ice
	thickness. Estimates of basal slipperiness are not significantly
	improved by accurate prior estimates of basal topography. However,
	retrieval of basal slipperiness is found to be highly sensitive to
	unmodelled errors in basal topography.},

  abstract = {We compare several different parallel implementation approaches for
	the clustering operations performed during adaptive meshing operations
	in patch-based structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) applications.
	Specifically, we target the clustering algorithm of Berger and Rigoutsos,
	which is commonly used in many SAMR applications. The baseline for
	comparison is a single program, multiple data extension of the original
	algorithm that works well for up to O(102) processors. Our goal is
	a clustering algorithm for machines of up to O(105) processors, such
	as the 64K-processor IBM BlueGene/L (BG/L) system. We first present
	an algorithm that avoids unneeded communications of the baseline
	approach, improving the clustering speed by up to an order of magnitude.
	We then present a new task-parallel implementation to further reduce
	communication wait time, adding another order of magnitude of improvement.
	The new algorithms exhibit more favorable scaling behavior for our
	test problems. Performance is evaluated on a number of large-scale
	parallel computer systems, including a 16K-processor BG/L system.},

  abstract = {A proper choice of a proposal distribution for Markov chain Monte
	Carlo methods, for example for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm,

	In this paper we introduce an adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm,
	where the Gaussian proposal distribution is updated along the process
	using the full information cumulated so far. Due to the adaptive
	nature of the process, the AM algorithm is non-Markovian, but we
	establish here that it has the correct ergodic properties. We also
	include the results of our numerical tests, which indicate that the
	AM algorithm competes well with traditional Metropolis-Hastings algorithms,
	and demonstrate that the AM algorithm is easy to use in practical
	computation.},

	Only the choice of entropy variables satisfies exactly the discrete

	for the rest of the variables, artificial diffusion is required to
	guarantee entropy production. The limit of the formulation is well
	defined for entropy variables and the primitive variables (p, u,

	is stable for any continuous interpolations, both for compressible

  abstract = {The optical behaviour of a surface carrying a transition layer is
	discussed, as a problem in scattering. The results are given of the
	application of electromagnetic theory to the case of a single parallel-sided
	film. Methods are given for extending this treatment to the case
	of multiple parallel-sided layers. Both analytical and graphical
	solutions are considered. Features governing the design of certain
	multilayer systems are given. A survey is made of the many methods
	now available for the determination of the thickness and optical
	constants of materials in the form of thin films. The range, accuracy
	and conditions of application of the various methods are summarized.
	A selection of the results obtained on a range of metallic and dielectric
	films is made and the basis of interpretation of these results is
	given. It is shown that the apparently anomalous variations of the
	optical constants of metal films with film thickness can be attributed
	to the granular nature of such films. Although less spectacular variations
	are observed in the properties of dielectric films, it is seen that
	for some materials the optical behaviour suggests the presence of
	marked inhomogeneity and anisotropy. Films formed chemically and
	electrolytically are briefly mentioned. Recent methods of controlling
	the thickness of films during deposition are given, together with
	a selection of the more important applications of thin films in optics.
	These include anti-reflecting and high reflecting systems, narrow-band,
	wide-band and cut-on multilayer filters, the use of thin films in
	polarizing systems and the application of thin films in heat-absorbing
	systems.},

	In addition, an index for identification of key uncertain parameters,

  abstract = {We investigate the ultra weak variational formulation for simulating
	time-harmonic Maxwell problems. This study has two main goals. First,
	we introduce a novel derivation of the UWVF method which shows that
	the UWVF is an unusual version of the standard upwind discontinuous
	Galerkin (DG) method with a special choice of basis functions. Second,
	we discuss the practical implementation of an electromagnetic UWVF
	solver. In particular, we propose a method to avoid the conditioning
	problems that are known to hamper the use of the UWVF for problems
	in general geometries and inhomogeneous media. In addition, we show
	how to implement the PML in the UWVF to accurately approximate physically
	unbounded problems and discuss the parallelization of the UWVF. Three-dimensional
	numerical simulations are used to examine the feasibility of the
	UWVF for simulating wave propagation in inhomogeneous media and scattering
	from complex structures.},

  abstract = {A computationally efficient means for propagation of uncertainty in
	computational models is provided by the stochastic response surface
	method (SRSM), which facilitates uncertainty analysis through the
	determination of statistically equivalent reduced models. SRSM expresses
	random outputs in terms of a {\tt{}"{}}polynomial chaos expansion{\tt{}"{}}
	of Hermite polynomials, and uses an efficient collocation scheme
	with regression to determine the coefficients of the expansion. This
	polynomial form then allows straightforward determination of statistics
	such as the mean and variance, and of first and second order sensitivity
	information. Further improvements in computational efficiency are
	achieved by coupling SRSM with automated source code differentiation
	tools, which produce code for partial derivatives with respect to
	model inputs and parameters. One such combination is the SRSM-ADIFOR,
	a combination of SRSM with the automatic differentiation of FORTRAN
	(ADIFOR). ADIFOR provides estimates of partial derivatives from a
	single model run, and this partial derivative information is used
	in the determination of the coefficients of the polynomial chaos
	expansions. Furthermore, SRSM can be used in conjunction with Bayesian
	methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to reduce
	uncertainties by incorporating observational information in estimates
	of model parameters. An overview of the application of SRSM, SRSM-ADIFOR,
	and the combined SRSM and MCMC methods to complex mechanistic models
	describing environmental systems is presented here, and the advantages
	over traditional techniques are discussed.},

	operators is discussed. We employ and generalize the enhancement
	techniques based on BV- and Perona-Malik-type regularization methods.
	The problem is cast as the minimization of a cost functional consisting
	of a data fitting and a restoration energy criterion for multiscale
	objects consisting of edge, flat and grey regions. An iterative algorithm
	for finding the restored object that minimizes the cost functional
	is developed and analysed. It is based upon a fixed-point iteration
	combining a time-marching and successive substitution method for
	finding a solution to a quasi-elliptic partial differential equation.
	Global convergence is proved. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed
	approach.},

  abstract = {Although climate models have steadily improved their ability to reproduce
	the observed climate, over the years there has been little change
	to the wide range of sensitivities exhibited by different models
	to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Stochastic optimization
	is used to mimic how six independent climate model development efforts
	might use the same atmospheric general circulation model, set of
	observational constraints, and model skill criteria to choose different
	settings for parameters thought to be important sources of uncertainty
	related to clouds and convection. Each optimized model improved its
	skill with respect to observations selected as targets of model development.
	Of particular note were the improvements seen in reproducing observed
	extreme rainfall rates over the Tropical pacific which was not specifically
	targeted during the optimization process. As compared to the default
	model sensitivity of 2.4{^\circ}C, the ensemble of optimized model
	configurations had larger and narrow range of sensitivities around
	3{^\circ}C, but with different regional responses related to the
	uncertain choice in optimized parameter settings. These results suggest
	current generation models, if similarly optimized, may become more
	convergent in their measure of global sensitivity to greenhouse gas
	forcing. However this exploration of the possible sources of modeling
	and observational uncertainty is not exhaustive. The optimization
	process illustrates an objective means for selecting an ensemble
	of plausible climate model configurations that quantify a portion
	of the uncertainty in the climate model development process.},

	of the method and its advantages over competing numerical methods
	for a wide range of applications for which the primary input originates
	from computed tomography-, magnetic resonance imaging- or other regular-grid
	medical imaging data. For this class of problems, the fictitious
	domain method is a natural choice, because it avoids the segmentation,
	surface reconstruction and meshing phases required by unstructured
	geometry-conforming simulation methods. We consider the implantation
	of a press-fit femoral artificial prosthesis as a prototype problem
	for sketching the application path of the methodology. Of concern
	is the assessment of the robustness and speed of the methodology,
	for both factors are critical if one were to consider patient-specific
	modelling. To this end, we report numerical results that exhibit
	optimal convergence rates and thus shed a favourable light on the
	approach.},

	constrain the depth dependence of mantle viscosity and buoyancy,
	requiring that the Farallon slab was flat lying in the Late Cretaceous,
	consistent with geological reconstructions. The simulation predicts
	that an extensive zone of shallow-dipping subduction extended beyond
	the flat-lying slab farther east and north by up to 1000 kilometers.
	The limited region of flat subduction is consistent with the notion
	that subduction of an oceanic plateau caused the slab to flatten.
	The results imply that seismic images of the current mantle provide
	more constraints on past tectonic events than previously recognized.},

	safely and reliably within design specifications.
	
	We show that concentration-of-measure inequalities rigorously bound
	probabilities of failure
	
	and thus supply conservative certification criteria. In addition,
	they supply unambiguous quantitative
	
	definitions of terms such as margins, epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties,
	verification and validation
	
	measures, confidence factors, and others, as well as providing clear
	procedures for computing these quantities
	
	by means of concerted simulation and experimental campaigns. We also
	investigate numerically
	
	the tightness of concentration-of-measure inequalities with the aid
	of an imploding ring example. Our
	
	numerical tests establish the robustness and viability of concentration-of-measure
	inequalities as a basis

	of incremental unknown is accomplished in finite elements by using

  title = {Recent advances in understanding ice sheet dynamics},

  year = {2005},
  volume = {240},
  pages = {191-204},
  abstract = {Glaciers and ice sheets play a dynamic role in Earth's climate system,
	influencing regional- and global-scale climate and
	
	responding to climate change on time scales from years to millennia.
	They are also an integral part of Earth's landscape in alpine
	
	and polar regions, where they are an active agent in isostatic, tectonic,
	and Earth surface processes. This review paper summarizes
	
	recent progress in understanding and modelling ice sheet dynamics,
	from the microphysical processes of ice deformation in glaciers
	
	to continental-scale processes that influence ice dynamics. Based
	on recent insights and research directions, it can be expected that
	
	a new generation of ice sheet models will soon replace the current
	standard. Improvements that can be foreseen in the near future
	
	include: (i) the addition of internally-consistent evolutionary equations
	for ice crystal fabric (anisotropic flow laws), (ii) more
	
	generalized flow laws that include different deformation mechanisms
	under different stress regimes, (iii) explicit incorporation of
	
	the effects of chemical impurities and grain size (dynamic recrystallization)
	on ice deformation, (iv) higher-order stress solutions to
	
	the momentum balance (Stokes' equation) that governs ice sheet flow,
	and (v) the continued merger of ice sheet models with
	
	increasingly complex Earth systems models, which include fully-coupled
	subglacial hydrological and geological processes.
	
	Examples from the Greenland Ice Sheet and Vatnajokull Ice Cap, Iceland
	are used to illustrate several of these new directions
	
	and their importance to glacier dynamics.},

  abstract = {The treatment of multioffset seismic data as an acoustic wave field
	is becoming increasingly disturbing to many geophysicists who see
	a multitude of wave phenomena, such as amplitude-offset variations
	and shearwave events, which can only be explained by using the more
	correct elastic wave equation. Not only are such phenomena ignored
	by acoustic theory, but they are also treated as undesirable noise
	when they should be used to provide extra information, such as $S$-wave
	velocity, about the subsurface.
	
	The problems of using the conventional acoustic wave equation approach
	can be eliminated via an elastic approach. In this paper, equations
	have been derived to perform an inversion for $P$-wave velocity,
	$S$-wave velocity, and density as well as the $P$-wave impedance,
	$S$-wave impedance, and density. These are better resolved than the
	Lam\'{e} parameters. The inversion is based on nonlinear least squares
	and proceeds by iteratively updating the earth parameters until a
	good fit is achieved between the observed data and the modeled data
	corresponding to these earth parameters. The iterations are based
	on the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. The fundamental
	requirement of such a least-squares algorithm is the gradient direction
	which tells how to update the model parameters. The gradient direction
	can be derived directly from the wave equation and it may be computed
	by several wave propagations. Although in principle any scheme could
	be chosen to perform the wave propagations, the elastic finite-difference
	method is used because it directly simulates the elastic wave equation
	and can handle complex, and thus realistic, distributions of elastic
	parameters. This method of inversion is costly since it is similar
	to an iterative prestack shot-profile migration. However, it has
	greater power than any migration since it solves for the $P$-wave
	velocity, $S$-wave velocity, and density and can handle very general
	situations including transmission problems.
	
	Three main weaknesses of this technique are that it requires fairly
	accurate a priori knowledge of the low-wavenumber velocity model,
	it assumes Gaussian model statistics, and it is very computer-intensive.
	All these problems seem surmountable. The low-wavenumber information
	can be obtained either by a prior tomographic step, by the conventional
	normal-moveout method, by a priori knowledge and empirical relationships,
	or by adding an additional inversion step for low wavenumbers to
	each iteration. The Gaussian statistics can be altered by preconditioning
	the gradient direction, perhaps to make the solution blocky in appearance
	like well logs, or by using large model variances in the inversion
	to reduce the effect of the Gaussian model constraints. Moreover,
	with some improvements to the algorithm and more parallel computers,
	it is hoped the technique will soon become routinely feasible.},

  abstract = {The Colorado Plateau contains Late Cretaceous marine strata that are
	at a mean elevation of ~2 km. The timing and amount of uplift since
	the Cretaceous has generated considerable debate. With the exception
	of a few studies, topography supported by vertical stresses generated
	by viscous flow in the mantle has not been explicitly considered
	to contribute to the elevation of this region. Herein we compute
	the viscous flow beneath North America that is driven by density
	anomalies inferred from joint seismic-geodynamic modeling. We find
	that the Colorado Plateau overlies a strong mantle upwelling that
	is coupled to the sinking Farallon slab, currently beneath the eastern
	United States. Consequently, the Colorado Plateau is currently a
	focused dynamic topography high within the western U.S. Cordillera.
	Moreover, this strong upwelling impacts the base of the lithosphere
	at an oblique angle east of the plateau directly below the Rio Grande
	Rift. We attribute this flow as being responsible for some of the
	recent magmatic activity along the Jemez lineament as well as contributing
	to the recent rifting process in the Rio Grande Rift valley.},

	the solution of an inverse heat conduction problem in the presence

	noise. The ill-posed stochastic inverse problem is restated as a

	of the objective function is obtained in a distributional sense by
	defining an appropriate stochastic adjoint field. The $L_2$ optimization
	problem is solved using a conjugate-gradient approach. Accuracy and
	effectiveness of the proposed approach is appraised with the solution
	of several stochastic inverse heat conduction problems.},

  abstract = {This work proposes and analyzes an anisotropic sparse grid stochastic
	collocation method for solving partial differential equations with
	random coefficients and forcing terms (input data of the model).
	The method consists of a Galerkin approximation in the space variables
	and a collocation, in probability space, on sparse tensor product
	grids utilizing either ClenshawCurtis or Gaussian knots. Even
	in the presence of nonlinearities, the collocation approach leads
	to the solution of uncoupled deterministic problems, just as in the
	Monte Carlo method. This work includes a priori and a posteriori
	procedures to adapt the anisotropy of the sparse grids to each given
	problem. These procedures seem to be very effective for the problems
	under study. The proposed method combines the advantages of isotropic
	sparse collocation with those of anisotropic full tensor product
	collocation: the first approach is effective for problems depending
	on random variables which weigh approximately equally in the solution,
	while the benefits of the latter approach become apparent when solving
	highly anisotropic problems depending on a relatively small number
	of random variables, as in the case where input random variables
	are KarhunenLo\`{e}ve truncations of \glqq smooth\grqq \ random
	fields. This work also provides a rigorous convergence analysis of
	the fully discrete problem and demonstrates (sub)exponential convergence
	in the asymptotic regime and algebraic convergence in the preasymptotic
	regime, with respect to the total number of collocation points. It
	also shows that the anisotropic approximation breaks the \textit{curse
	of dimensionality} for a wide set of problems. Numerical examples
	illustrate the theoretical results and are used to compare this approach
	with several others, including the standard Monte Carlo. In particular,
	for moderately large-dimensional problems, the sparse grid approach
	with a properly chosen anisotropy seems to be very efficient and
	superior to all examined methods.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an inter-comparison of three different models
	applied to various
	
	glacier geometries. The three models are built on different approximations
	of the
	
	Stokes equations, from the well known Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA)
	to the full-
	
	5 Stokes (FS) solution with an intermediate higher-order (HO) model
	which incorporates
	
	longitudinal stresses. The studied glaciers are synthetic geometries,
	but two of them
	
	are constructed so as to mimic a valley glacier and a volcano glacier.
	For each class
	
	of glacier, the bedrock slope and/or the aspect ratio are varied.
	First, the models are
	
	compared in a diagnostic way for a fixed and given geometry. Here
	the SIA surface ve10
	
	locity can overestimate the FS velocity by a factor of 5 to a factor
	of 10. Then, the free
	
	surface is allowed to evolve and the time-dependent evolution of the
	glacier is studied.
	
	As a result, the difference between the models decreases, but can
	still be as large as
	
	a factor of 1.5 to 2. This decrease can be explained by a negative
	feedback for the SIA
	
	which overestimates velocities.},

	The error estimator assesses the discretization error with respect

	of the time and space discretizations. This allows us to set up an
	efficient adaptive strategy producing economical (locally) refined
	meshes for each time step and an adapted time discretization. The
	space and time discretization errors are equilibrated, leading to

  abstract = {We present an application of the newly developed CAFFE model (Continuum-mechanical,
	
	Anisotropic Flow model based on an anisotropic Flow Enhancement factor)
	to the EPICA ice core at
	
	Kohnen Station, DronningMaud Land, Antarctica (referred to as the
	EDML core). A one-dimensional flow
	
	model for the site is devised, which includes the anisotropic flow
	law and the fabric evolution equation
	
	of the CAFFE model. Three different solution methods are employed:
	(i) computing the ice flow based
	
	on the flow law of the CAFFE model and the measured fabrics; (ii)
	solving the CAFFE fabric evolution
	
	equation under the simplifying assumption of transverse isotropy;
	and (iii) solving the unrestricted CAFFE
	
	fabric evolution equation. Method (i) demonstrates clearly the importance
	of the anisotropic fabric in the
	
	ice column for the flow velocity. The anisotropic enhancement factor
	produced with method (ii) agrees
	
	reasonably well with that of method (i), even though the measured
	fabric shows a girdle structure (which
	
	breaks the transverse isotropy) in large parts of the ice core. For
	method (iii), we find that the measured
	
	fabric is reproduced well by the model down to ?2100m depth. Systematic
	deviations at greater depths
	
	are attributed to the disregard of migration recrystallization in
	the model.},

	images based on exponentially-convergent adaptive higher-order finite
	element methods (FEM). So far, FEM has been used mainly for the solution
	of partial differential equations (PDE), but we show that it can
	be applied to data and image compression easily. The adaptive compression
	algorithm is trivial compared to adaptive FEM algorithms for PDE
	since the error estimation step is not present. The method attains
	extremely high compression rates and is able to compress a data set
	or an image with any prescribed error tolerance. Compressed data
	and images are stored in the standard FEM format, which makes it
	possible to analyze them using standard PDE visualization software.
	Numerical examples are shown. The method is presented in such a way
	that it can be understood by readers who may not be experts of the
	finite element method.},

  abstract = {The subject of inverse problems in differential equations is of enormous
	practical importance, and has also generated substantial mathematical
	and computational innovation. Typically some form of regularization
	is required to ameliorate ill-posed behaviour. In this article we
	review the Bayesian approach to regularization, developing a function
	space viewpoint on the subject. This approach allows for a full characterization
	of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst
	simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed
	in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement,
	this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available
	computational resources in many application areas. It also allows
	for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is
	increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach
	is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally
	expedient approaches to inverse problems.},

	and 2:1 balance refinement of large linear octrees on distributed
	memory machines. Such octrees are used in many problems in computational
	science and engineering, e.g., object representation, image analysis,
	unstructured meshing, finite elements, adaptive mesh refinement,
	and N-body simulations. Fixed-size scalability and isogranular analysis
	of the algorithms using an MPI-based parallel implementation was
	performed on a variety of input data and demonstrated good scalability
	for different processor counts (1 to 1024 processors) on the Pittsburgh
	Supercomputing Center's TCS-1 AlphaServer. The results are consistent
	for different data distributions. Octrees with over a billion octants
	were constructed and balanced in less than a minute on 1024 processors.
	Like other existing algorithms for constructing and balancing octrees,
	our algorithms have $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ work and $\mathcal{O}(N)$
	storage complexity. Under reasonable assumptions on the distribution
	of octants and the work per octant, the parallel time complexity
	is $\mathcal{O}(\frac{N}{n_p}\log(\frac{N}{n_p})+n_p\log n_p)$, where
	N is the size of the final linear octree and $n_p$ is the number
	of processors.},

	of reflection seismograms which avoids the severe convergence difficulties
	associated with nonlinear least-squares inversion. The method exploits
	both moveout and amplitude characteristics of reflections. We have
	implemented a version appropriate to plane-wave ($p$-tau) seismograms
	and layered constant-density acoustic earth models. Theoretical and
	numerical analyses of this version of DSO indicate that stable and
	reasonably accurate estimates of both velocity trend and reflectivity
	can be derived. To test DSO further, we applied it to a marine data
	set from the Gulf of Mexico, where the method produced results which
	compare favorably to well-log information. The method can be extended
	to incorporate laterally heterogeneous velocity models.},

	According to wave propagation theory, the number of wave nodes and
	their wave propagation characteristics are all encoded in the dispersion
	relations of the governing equations. Thus one is assured that the
	numerical solutions of a high order finite difference scheme will
	have the same number of wave modes (namely, the acoustic vorticity
	and entropy waves), the same wave propagation characteristics (namely,
	nondispersive, nondissipative, and isotropic) and the same wave speeds
	as those of the solutions of the Euler equations if both systems
	of equations have the same dispersion relations. Finite difference
	schemes which have the same dispersion relations as the original
	partial differential equations are referred to as dispersion-relation-preserving
	(DRP) schemes. A way to construct time marching DRP schemes by optimizing
	the finite difference approximations of the space and time derivatives
	in the wave number and frequency space is proposed. The stability
	of these schemes is analyzed as a sufficient condition for numerical
	stability is established. A set of radiation and outflow boundary
	conditions compatible with the DRP schemes is constructed.},

	data},
  journal = {Geophysics},
  year = {1986},
  volume = {51},
  pages = {1893--1903},
  number = {10},
  abstract = {The problem of interpretation of seismic reflection data can be posed
	with sufficient generality using the concepts of inverse theory.
	In its roughest formulation, the inverse problem consists of obtaining
	the Earth model for which the predicted data best fit the observed
	data. If an adequate forward model is used, this best model will
	give the best images of the Earths interior. Three parameters
	are needed for describing a perfectly elastic, isotropic, Earth:
	the density $\rho(x)$ and the Lam\'{e} parameters $\lambda(x)$ and
	$\mu(x)$, or the density $\rho(x)$ and the $P$-wave and $S$-wave
	velocities $\alpha(x)$ and $\beta(x)$. The choice of parameters is
	not neutral, in the sense that although theoretically equivalent,
	if they are not adequately chosen the numerical algorithms in the
	inversion can be inefficient. In the long (spatial) wavelengths of
	the model, adequate parameters are the $P$-wave and $S$-wave velocities,
	while in the short (spatial) wavelengths, $P$-wave impedance, $S$-wave
	impedance, and density are adequate. The problem of inversion of
	waveforms is highly nonlinear for the long wavelengths of the velocities,
	while it is reasonably linear for the short wavelengths of the impedances
	and density. Furthermore, this parameterization defines a highly
	hierarchical problem: the long wavelengths of the $P$-wave velocity
	and short wavelengths of the $P$-wave impedance are much more important
	parameters than their counterparts for $S$-waves (in terms of interpreting
	observed amplitudes), and the latter are much more important than
	the density. This suggests solving the general inverse problem (which
	must involve all the parameters) by first optimizing for the $P$-wave
	velocity and impedance, then optimizing for the $S$-wave velocity
	and impedance, and finally optimizing for density.
	
	The first part of the problem of obtaining the long wavelengths of
	the $P$-wave velocity and the short wavelengths of the $P$-wave impedance
	is similar to the problem solved by present industrial practice (for
	accurate data interpretation through velocity analysis and \glqq
	prestack migration\grqq). In fact, the method proposed here produces
	(as a byproduct) a generalization to the elastic case of the equations
	of \glqq prestack acoustic migration.\grqq Once an adequate model
	of the long wavelengths of the $P$-wave velocity and of the short
	wavelengths of the $P$-wave impedance has been obtained, the data
	residuals should essentially contain information on $S$-waves (essentially
	$P-S$ and $S-P$ converted waves). Once the corresponding model of
	$S$-wave velocity (long wavelengths) and $S$-wave impedance (short
	wavelengths) has been obtained, and if the remaining residuals still
	contain information, an optimization for density should be performed
	(the short wavelengths of impedances do not give independent information
	on density and velocity independently).
	
	Because the problem is nonlinear, the whole process should be iterated
	to convergence; however, the information from each parameter should
	be independent enough for an interesting first solution.},

  abstract = {The \textit{nonlinear} inverse problem for seismic reflection data
	is solved in the acoustic approximation. The method is based on the
	generalized leastsquares criterion, and it can handle errors in
	the data set and a priori information on the model. Multiply reflected
	energy is naturally taken into account, as well as refracted energy
	or surface waves. The inverse problem can be solved using an iterative
	algorithm which gives, at each iteration, updated values of bulk
	modulus, density, and time source function. Each step of the iterative
	algorithm essentially consists of a forward propagation of the actual
	sources in the current model and a forward propagation (backward
	in time) of the data residuals. The correlation at each point of
	the space of the two fields thus obtained yields the corrections
	of the bulk modulus and density models. This shows, in particular,
	that the general solution of the inverse problem can be attained
	by methods strongly related to the methods of migration of unstacked
	data, and commercially competitive with them.},

	a good partition that can be found efficiently sequentially and in

	with equal computation load by removing only $O(\sqrt{n\log n})$
	and $O(n^{2/3} (\log n)^{1/3})$ number of nodes, respectively, for

  abstract = {Representation of till rheology in glaciological models of ice motion
	over deformable sediments has, until now, focused largely on two
	end-member cases: (1) linear, or mildly non-linear, viscous rheology
	and (2) (nearly) plastic rheology. Most laboratory and in situ experiments
	support the latter model. Hindmarsh (1997) and Fowler (2002, 2003)
	proposed that experimental results represent the behavior of small
	till samples (characteristic length scales of \~{}0.1 to \~{}1 m)
	but that till behaves viscously over length scales that are relevant
	to determination of ice-flow rates in glaciers and ice sheets (\~{}1
	km or more). Observations of short speed-up events on the ice plain
	of Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, provide an opportunity to
	compare the in situ rheology of this till, integrated over \~{}10-100
	km, with the rheology of till from beneath the same ice stream determined
	on small laboratory samples and in local borehole experiments. This
	comparison indicates that the rheology of the subglacial till beneath
	Whillans Ice Stream is independent of scale.},

	profile and the conductivity profile of one-dimensional inhomogeneons
	medium which makes use of the transverse electric (TE) wave and/or
	transverse magnetic (TM) wave, is proposed. The medium is illuminated
	by the TE and/or TM plane wave at oblique incidence, and the data
	are taken as the reflection coefficients for a set of discrete frequencies
	and/or a finite number of incident angles. Furthermore, the reflection
	coefficient data contain the Gaussian noise. The nonlinear integral
	equation relating the unknown constitutive parameter of the medium
	to the reflection coefficient for TE wave and/or TM wave is solved
	by the Newton iteration method. The inverse operator in the Newton
	method is determined by the regularization method. It is demonstrated
	in terms of the numerical examples that this method utilizing both
	polarizations and the incident angle of the incident plane wave is
	very effective even if the reflection coefficient contains the practical
	measurement error, or the phase of the reflection coefficient is
	unknown. Moreover, the relationships between the errors of reconstructed
	profile and the measured reflection coefficient are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Stochastic inverse problems in heat conduction with consideration
	of uncertainties in the measured temperature data, temperature sensor
	locations and thermophysical properties are addressed using a Bayesian
	statistical inference method. Both parameter estimation and thermal
	history reconstruction problems, including boundary heat flux and
	heat source reconstruction, are studied. Probabilistic specification
	of the unknown variables is deduced from temperature measurements.
	Hierarchical Bayesian models are adopted to relax the prior assumptions
	on the unknowns. The use of a hierarchical Bayesian method for automatic
	selection of the regularization parameter in the function estimation
	inverse problem is discussed. In addition, the method explores the
	length scales in the estimation of thermal variables varying in space
	and time. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is conducted
	to explore the high dimensional posterior state space. The methodologies
	presented are general and applicable to a number of data-driven engineering
	inverse problems. },

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview and a detailed description of the
	key logic steps and mathematical-physics framework behind the development
	of practical algorithms for seismic exploration derived from the
	inverse scattering series.
	
	There are both significant symmetries and critical subtle differences
	between the forward scattering series construction and the inverse
	scattering series processing of seismic events. These similarities
	and differences help explain the efficiency and effectiveness of
	different inversion objectives. The inverse series performs all of
	the tasks associated with inversion using the entire wavefield recorded
	on the measurement surface as input. However, certain terms in the
	series act as though only one specific task, and no other task, existed.
	When isolated, these terms constitute a task-specific subseries.
	We present both the rationale for seeking and methods of identifying
	uncoupled task-specific subseries that accomplish: (1) free-surface
	multiple removal; (2) internal multiple attenuation; (3) imaging
	primaries at depth; and (4) inverting for earth material properties.
	
	A combination of forward series analogues and physical intuition is
	employed to locate those subseries. We show that the sum of the four
	task-specific subseries does not correspond to the original inverse
	series since terms with coupled tasks are never considered or computed.
	Isolated tasks are accomplished sequentially and, after each is achieved,
	the problem is restarted as though that isolated task had never existed.
	This strategy avoids choosing portions of the series, at any stage,
	that correspond to a combination of tasks, i.e., no terms corresponding
	to coupled tasks are ever computed. This inversion in stages provides
	a tremendous practical advantage. The achievement of a task is a
	form of useful information exploited in the redefined and restarted
	problem; and the latter represents a critically important step in
	the logic and overall strategy. The individual subseries are analysed
	and their strengths, limitations and prerequisites exemplified with
	analytic, numerical and field data examples.},

	the clustering operations performed during adaptive meshing operations
	in patch-based structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) applications.
	Specifically, we target the clustering algorithm of Berger and Rigoutsos,
	which is commonly used in many SAMR applications. The baseline for
	comparison is a single program, multiple data extension of the original
	algorithm that works well for up to O(102) processors. Our goal is
	a clustering algorithm for machines of up to O(105) processors, such
	as the 64K-processor IBM BlueGene/L (BG/L) system. We first present
	an algorithm that avoids unneeded communications of the baseline
	approach, improving the clustering speed by up to an order of magnitude.
	We then present a new task-parallel implementation to further reduce
	communication wait time, adding another order of magnitude of improvement.
	The new algorithms exhibit more favorable scaling behavior for our
	test problems. Performance is evaluated on a number of large-scale
	parallel computer systems, including a 16K-processor BG/L system.},

  abstract = {In this paper multigrid smoothers of Vanka-type are studied in the
	context of Computational SolidMechanics (CSM). These smoothers were
	originally developed to solve saddle-point systems arising in the
	field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), particularly for incompressible
	flow problems. When treating (nearly) incompressible solids, similar
	equation systems arise so that it is reasonable to adopt the Vanka
	idea for CSM. While there exist numerous studies about Vanka smoothers
	in the CFD literature, only few publications describe applications
	to solid mechanical problems. With this paper we want to contribute
	to close this gap. We depict and compare four different Vanka-like
	smoothers, two of them are oriented towards the stabilised equal-order
	$Q_1/Q_1$ finite element pair. By means of different test configurations
	we assess how far the smoothers are able to handle the numerical
	difficulties that arise for nearly incompressible material and anisotropic
	meshes. On the one hand, we show that the efficiency of \textit{all}
	Vanka-smoothers heavily depends on the proper parameter choice. On
	the other hand, we demonstrate that only \textit{some} of them are
	able to robustly deal with more critical situations. Furthermore,
	we illustrate how the enclosure of the multigrid scheme by an outer
	Krylov space method influences the overall solver performance, and
	we extend all our examinations to the nonlinear finite deformation
	case.},

  abstract = {An effective hp-adaptive finite-element (FE) approach is presented
	for a reliable and accurate solution of 3D electromagnetic scattering
	problems. The far field is approximated with the infinite-element
	method. This allows one to reduce the external domain (discretised
	with finite elements) to a minimum preserving the possibility of
	arbitrary reduction of the error as the method does not introduce
	modelling error. The work is focused on scattering from cavity backed
	apertures recessed in a ground plane. Near optimal discretisations
	that can effectively resolve local rapid variations in the scattered
	field can be obtained adaptively by local mesh refinements (so called
	h-type refinements) blended with graded polynomial enrichments (p-enrichments).
	The discretisation error can be controlled by a self-adaptive process,
	which is driven by a posteriori error estimates in terms of the energy
	norm or in a quantity of interest. The radar cross section (RCS)
	is an example of the latter. h- and p-adaptively constructed solutions
	are compared to pure uniform p approximations. Numerical, highly
	accurate, and fairly converged solutions for generic cavities are
	given and compared to previously published results.},
