/** These are our log levels, sorted by priority.
 * These levels have two different roles to play:
 *
 * 1. Each logging function is suffixed with its priority.
 *    This means that FCLAW_VERBOSITY_ESSENTIAL should only be used
 *    for very important messages, such as a version number on startup,
 *    and FCLAW_VERBOSITY_ERROR for unexpected error conditions.  Conversely,
 *    log messages that help in debugging and clutter the output a lot can use
 *    the FCLAW_VERBOSITY_DEBUG priority.
 * 2. The function \b sc_package_set_verbosity
 *    accepts a priority level below which all messages will be ignored.
 *    Eventually, the \ref fclaw_app_t object will read the desired
 *    verbosity from the command line and/or configuration files.
 *    As an example, if the verbosity is set to FCLAW_VERBOSITY_INFO, then
 *    debug messages will not be printed, but essential messages will.
 *
 * The verbosity of libraries, like p4est and sc, can be controlled
 * individually, and separately from the verbosity of forestclaw.
 * For production runs, try to set the verbosity to PRODUCTION or ESSENTIAL.
 *
 * Valid ForestClaw settings:
 *     FCLAW_VERBOSITY_DEFAULT, DEBUG, INFO, PRODUCTION, ESSENTIAL, ERROR, SILENT
 * (although I suppose we could use others; see below for the list of SC_LP_ values).
 *
 * * PRODUCTION messages should log a few lines for a major api function.
 *              A good example would be the numerical error at the
 *              end of the program, timings, printing important parameters.
 * * ESSENTIAL messages must only cause a few lines for the whole run, if at all.
 * * ERROR messages should only be printed when something goes wrong.  Setting the
 *              verbosity to ERROR omits even essential messages and prints errors only.
 * * DEFAULT depends on the configure options `--enable-debug` and `--enable_logging=...`
 *              With `--enable-debug`, this will be a very chatty at level DEBUG.
 *              Otherwise it is INFO, if not overridden with `--enable-logging=...`
 *
 * This is copied from \b sc.h for reference:
 *
 * For debugging, try INFO or PRODUCTION for libraries and DEBUG for forestclaw.
 *
 *     #define SC_LP_DEFAULT   (-1)    this selects the SC default threshold
 *     #define SC_LP_ALWAYS      0     this will log everything
 *     #define SC_LP_TRACE       1     this will prefix file and line number
 *     #define SC_LP_DEBUG       2     any information on the internal state
 *     #define SC_LP_VERBOSE     3     information on conditions, decisions
 *     #define SC_LP_INFO        4     the main things a function is doing
 *     #define SC_LP_STATISTICS  5     important for consistency/performance
 *     #define SC_LP_PRODUCTION  6     a few lines for a major api function
 *     #define SC_LP_ESSENTIAL   7     this logs a few lines max per program
 *     #define SC_LP_ERROR       8     this logs errors only
 *     #define SC_LP_SILENT      9     this never logs anything
