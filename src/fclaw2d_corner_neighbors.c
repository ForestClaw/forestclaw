   Four cases to consider.   The 'has_corner_neighbor'
   value is returned from p4est.  The assumption going
   into this routine is that we have found a valid
   interior corner (not a corner on a physical boundary).
   The corner than satisfies one of the following four
   cases.

   Case No. | has_corner_neighbor  |  is_block_corner
   --------------------------------------------------------
      1     |       T              |        T
      2     |       F              |        F
      3     |       T              |        F
      4     |       F              |        T

    Case 1 : In this case, 4 or more patches meet at a block
             corner. No transforms are yet available, so we 
             assume that at block corners, the patches all 
             have the same orientation.
    Case 2 : Corner is at a hanging node and has no valid
             adjacent corner.
    Case 3 : Corner is either interior to a block, or on a
             block edge.  In each case, the transform is
             well-defined.
    Case 4 : Either 3 patches meet at a corner, in which
             case we don't have an adjacent corner, or we are
             on a pillow grid, in which case we have a 
             corner, but one which we nonetheless treat
             as a special case.
